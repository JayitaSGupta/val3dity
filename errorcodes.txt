## Ring level

  * 100 TOO_FEW_POINTS            ring has <3 points
  * 110 CONSECUTIVE_POINTS_SAME   2 consecutive points are the same 
  * 120 RING_NOT_CLOSED           first-last points are not the same 
  * 130 RING_SELF_INTERSECT       ring self-intersects or is collapsed to a point or a line 

## Surface level (one polygon embedded in 3D)

  * 200 INTERSECTION_RINGS        rings of the surface intersect
  * 210 NON_PLANAR_SURFACE        surface is not planar
  * 220 INTERIOR_DISCONNECTED     interior of surface is not connected
  * 230 HOLE_OUTSIDE              1 or more holes are located outside the extering
  * 240 HOLES_ARE_NESTED          holes of the surface are nested inside other
  * 250 ORIENTATION_RINGS_SAME    exterior and interior rings have same orientation
