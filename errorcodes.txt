# Surface level

  * 200   : exterior ring and interior rings have same orientation
  * 210   : surface is not planar
  * 220   : surface is not valid in 2D (its projection)
    * 221 : interior ring intersect exterior ring
    * 222 : interior ring outside exterior ring
    * 223 : interior rings intersect
    * 224 : interior not connected


# Shell level

  * 300   : is not a 2-manifold
    * 301 : surface is not closed
    * 302 : dangling faces 
    * 303 : one(several) face(s) not connected to the 2-manifold 
    * 304 : orientation of one/several face(s) not correct 
    * 305 : surface self-intersect
  * 310   : normals not pointing in correct direction (all of them)


# Solid level

  * 400   : shells are face adjacent
  * 410   : interior of shells intersect
  * 420   : interior shell completely outside the exterior shell
  * 430   : interior not connected
