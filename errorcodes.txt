## Ring level

  * 100 TOO_FEW_POINTS            ring has <3 points
  * 110 CONSECUTIVE_POINTS_SAME   2 consecutive points are the same 
  * 120 RING_NOT_CLOSED           first-last points are not the same 
  * 130 RING_SELF_INTERSECT       ring self-intersects or is collapsed to a point or a line 

## Surface level (one polygon embedded in 3D)

  * 200 INTERSECTION_RINGS        rings of the surface intersect
  * 210 NON_PLANAR_SURFACE        surface is not planar
  * 220 INTERIOR_DISCONNECTED     interior of surface is not connected
  * 230 HOLE_OUTSIDE              1 or more holes are located outside the extering
  * 240 HOLES_ARE_NESTED          holes of the surface are nested inside other
  * 250 ORIENTATION_RINGS_SAME    exterior and interior rings have same orientation

## Shell level (one envelop formed by several surfaces)

  * 300  NOT_VALID_2_MANIFOLD                 
  * 301  SURFACE_HAS_HOLE                       there is 1+ 'hole' somewhere on the surface 
  * 302  NON_MANIFOLD                           non-manifold case: dangling faces (more than 2 surfaces incident to an edge), several faces not forming an 'umbrella', etc.
  * 303  FACE_WRONG_ORIENTATION                 orientation of one or more faces not correct 
  * 304  FREE_FACE                              1+ faces not connected to the others (eg 'floating' in the air)
  * 305  SURFACE_SELF_INTERSECTS                surface self-intersect (is not simple)
  * 306  VERTICES_NOT_USED                      some vertices are not referenced by the faces (impossible with GML input)
  * 310  ALL_FACES_WRONG_ORIENTATION            normals all pointing in wrong direction (inwards for exterior shells; outward for interior shell)

## Solid level (1 exterior shell + [0..*n*] interior shells)

  * 400  SHELLS_FACE_ADJACENT            2+ shells are face adjacent
  * 410  SHELL_INTERIOR_INTERSECT        2+ shell overlap 
  * 420  INNER_SHELL_OUTSIDE_OUTER       1+ interior shell is located totally outside the exterior shell
  * 430  INTERIOR_OF_SHELL_NOT_CONNECTED interior of the solid not connected
