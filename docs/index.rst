(version |release|)

Validation of 3D primitives according to the international standard ISO19107.
Think of it as `PostGIS ST_IsValid  <http://postgis.net/docs/ST_IsValid.html>`_, but for 3D primitives (PostGIS is only for 2D ones).

It allows us to validate a 3D primitive, ie to verify whether it respects the definition as given in `ISO19107 <http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26012>`_ and GML/CityGML.
The 3D primitives of GML are all supported:

  - ``<gml:MultiSurface>``
  - ``<gml:CompositeSurface>`` 
  - ``<gml:Solid>``
  - ``<gml:MultiSolid>``
  - ``<gml:CompositeSolid>``

However, as is the case for CityGML, only planar and linear primitives are allowed: no curves or spheres or other parametrically-modelled primitives are supported (and there is no plan to do so!).
