(version |release|)

val3dity---pronounced 'val-three-dity'---allows us to validate 3D primitives according to the international standard ISO19107.
Think of it as `PostGIS ST_IsValid  <http://postgis.net/docs/ST_IsValid.html>`_, but for 3D primitives (PostGIS is only for 2D ones).

In short, it verifies whether a 3D primitive respects the definition as given in `ISO19107 <http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26012>`_ and GML/CityGML.
All the 3D primitives of GML are supported:

  - ``<gml:MultiSurface>``
  - ``<gml:CompositeSurface>`` 
  - ``<gml:Solid>``
  - ``<gml:MultiSolid>``
  - ``<gml:CompositeSolid>``

Unlike many other validation tools in 3D GIS, inner rings in polygons/surfaces are supported, and so are cavities in solids (also called voids or inner shells).
However, only planar and linear primitives are allowed: no curves or spheres or other parametrically-modelled primitives are supported (and there is no plan to do so!).

val3dity accepts as input:

  - `CityGML <https://www.citygml.org>`_ 
  - `CityJSON <http://www.cityjson.org>`_
  - any `GML file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language>`_
  - `OBJ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file>`_ 
  - `OFF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFF_(file_format)>`_
