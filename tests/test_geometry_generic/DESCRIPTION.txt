The intention is to isolate the geometry from the file format. The POLY format is simple, supports inner rings and the parser is reliable. Therefore each geometry error case(http://val3dity.readthedocs.io/en/v2/errors/#) is tested with the POLY format *only*. Don't replicate these geometry error cases in different file formats, because test maintenance will become very error prone (ie update one file but forget the other...).
