# Geometry errors

The intention is to isolate the geometry from the file format. The POLY format is simple, supports inner rings and the parser is reliable. Therefore each geometry [error case](http://val3dity.readthedocs.io/en/v2/errors/#) is tested with the POLY format *only*. Don't replicate these geometry error cases in different file formats, because test maintenance will become very error prone (ie update one file but forget the other...).

# File formats

Here each file contains the same, valid geometry. Thus the various formatting options and errors are tested.

## 901

# Valid data

Valid files in each format. One should be enough per format.

# Empty files

Try to break val3dity by giving it (partially) empty files in each format.

## 902

# Format specific geometry errors

Error cases that are only relevant for a particular format and cannot be modelled by each format, thus don't belong to *Geometry errors* (eg 601).

# User input
