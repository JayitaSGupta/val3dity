# val3dity

Validation of solids according to the international standard ISO 19107.

The validation of a solid is performed hierarchically, ie first every surface is validated in 2D (with [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/)), then every shell is validated (must be watertight, no self-intersections, orientation of the normals must be consistent and pointing outwards, etc), and finally the interactions between the shells are analysed.

Most of the details are available in this scientific article:

> Ledoux, Hugo (2013). On the validation of solids represented with the
international standards for geographic information. *Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering*, 28(9):693-706. [ [PDF] ](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/pdfs/13_cacaie.pdf) [ [DOI] ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mice.12043)


## How do I use val3dity?

It is a command-line program, which we provide as source code, together with makefiles for Mac and Linux. 

For Windows, we do not have binaries at this moment, but you can use the [web interface](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity). 

To compile val3dity yourself, you first need to install the following free libraries 

  1. [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org), 
  1. [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) 
  1. [CMake](http://www.cmake.org)
  1. [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org)

Under Mac we suggest using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Afterwards run:

    $ cmake .
    $ make
    
To execute val3dity and see its options:

    $ ./val3dity --help
    
To validate all the solids in a GML or CityGML file:

    $ ./val3dity myfile.gml

Each `<gml:Solid>` in the file will be individually validated and a summary report will be output. 

For a full report in XML format:

    $ ./val3dity myfile.gml --oxml report.xml

Other formats can also be used as input, the volumetric primitives are then validated according to ISO19107 definitions:

  1. OBJ (a file can contain more than 1 object, each will be validated individually)
  1. OFF
  1. [POLY](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/1.5/doc/manual/manual006.html#ff_poly), there are a several examples of test datasets in the folder `data/poly/`, the `README.txt`
  1. [all the formats supported by Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/main_features_formats.html) can in theory be used, although I haven't tested them all. OBJ and OFF surely works.

This [FAQ for the web-application](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity/faq) can help answer some questions I believe.


# Web-application

If you're running Windows and/or you don't want to go through the troubles of compiling, we suggest you use the [web application](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity). It takes as input a GML file (of any flavour, including CityGML for instance) containing one or more `<gml:Solids>`.


# Configurations

It is possible to define some tolerances for the planarity of surfaces with the flag `--planarity_n 0.1` which would mean that the points representing a surface should be at a maximum distance of 0.1m (or units, val3dity doesn't reproject or perform any change to the input coordinates) to a plane fitted with least-square adjustment to the points.

Similarly, the input points in a GML files are snapped together using a tolerance, which can be changed with `--snap_tolerance XX`.
